Learning Summary
Although I have typed the code slowly following the tutorial, there is still a lot of knowledge that needs to be learned slowly in the future. Here is a brief note of the technologies and knowledge points involved in this project:

1. Use the new rem layout instead of the percentage layout solution;

2. Use a simple object-oriented programming solution to encapsulate each page scene element in the form of a class;

3. Introduce the Observer pattern as a processing mechanism;

4. Draw vector graphics through svg;

5. Use css3 animation;

6. Use of CSS3 transform and transition;

7. Implementation of 3D carousel: separate implementation demo , specific implementation process: CSS3 implementation of 3D carousel

8. Use canvas to achieve snowflake effect;

Final effect display: H5+JS+CSS3 learning on MOOC.com to achieve Christmas romance

This effect is slightly different from what is shown on the MOOC website and will be improved in the future!
